# playTest

playTest is a jupyter notebook based Dev Test project. 

It is designed to answer questions related to a PDF provided by a company as part of their Developer Test process. 

## Checking the code out...

I would recommend taking a copy of this repo as its largely built upon a jupyter notebook. 

The one custom module it relies upon for the NoSQL question is TinyDB and you should follow the link at the top of the jupyter notebook to ensure you install it correctly.
